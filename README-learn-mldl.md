Prepare to merge this repo with **Deep-Learning** repo - with histories.  
Folders moved out or repo and saved locally.

## Learning Python, ML (machine learning) and DL (deep learning)  
    
My goal is to document my progress at learning Python ML and DL on a GitHub repo.

#### History:  

 * 9/19/2020 -- Streamline repo, remove older class folders.   
 * Started on 7/17/2019 as a Github public repo.  
 * August and September 2019, add folders for CS231n, dlai (deep learning .ai), Chollet-DLPy book, 
   Vanderplas machine learning book.
 * February-March 2020, update dlai folders for more classes.  
 * June 10-11, 2020 - moved DLAI folder to "deep-learning" repo.  
 * June 12, 2020 -- moved local repo to Ubuntu side. 
 * June 22, 2020 -- move local repo back to C:/python/repos/ 
    - merge FluentPy repo into learn-mldl repo, keep histories. 
    - move from books/fluentpy/exercises - example code.
