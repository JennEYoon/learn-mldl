Q)
what is from .. space import basics?  (parent from current file imort x)
from .. space import vision?  (parent from current file import x)
what is from .. no space basics import?  (from current dir module x import y)
what is from .image import?  (from current dir module image, import y)
what is from . space import models?  (from current dir no module name, import module x)

Unix .. is parent and . is current directory.
Same in python 3.  Space after dot when no module name is given.
Test it out with my own examples

=============================================================
A)
Absolute vs. Relative Import
An absolute import uses the full path (starting from the project’s root folder) to the desired module to import.

A relative import uses the relative path (starting from the path of the current module) to the desired module to import. There are two types of relative imports:

an explicit relative import follows the format 
   from .<module/package> import X,
   
where <module/package> is prefixed by dots . that indicate how many directories upwards to traverse. A single dot . corresponds to the current directory; two dots .. indicate one folder up; etc.

An implicit relative import is written as if the current directory is part of sys.path. Implicit relative imports are only supported in Python 2. They are NOT SUPPORTED IN PYTHON 3.

For example, suppose we are running start.py which imports a1 which in turn imports other, a2, and sa1. Then the import statements in a1.py would look as follows:

absolute imports:
  import other
  import packA.a2
  import packA.subA.sa1
  
explicit relative imports:
  import other
  from . import a2
  from .subA import sa1
  
implicit relative imports (NOT SUPPORTED IN PYTHON 3):
  import other
  import a2
  import subA.sa1
  
Note that for relative imports, the dots . can go up only up to (but not including) the directory containing the script run from the command line. Thus, from .. import other is invalid in a1.py. Doing so results in the error ValueError: attempted relative import beyond top-level package.

In general, absolute imports are preferred over relative imports. They avoid the confusion between explicit vs. implicit relative imports. In addition, any script that uses explicit relative imports cannot be run directly:

Note that relative imports are based on the name of the current module. Since the name of the main module is always “main”, modules intended for use as the main module of a Python application must always use absolute imports.
