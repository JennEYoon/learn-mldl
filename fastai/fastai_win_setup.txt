# Setup fastai v1.0 on Windows 10.

conda3 env "fastv1"

Software needs to be installed with a package manager, conda.
Saw instructions somewhere.  Something like this. 

 * conda install -c fastai fastai -c ... pytorch
 
Current software load works with fastai v 1.0 and fastai repo download.

Module folder path in class repo needs to be kept same.
 * Tested 00_Notebook_setup/help file
 * Tested importing vision.
-----------------------------------------

Uses Python 3 explicit relative path in fastai modules.

from . import module1
from .module1 import sub1
from .module1.sub1 import subsub2

from .. import parent1
from ..parent1 import chdofparent1
from ..parent1.chd1 import chdchdofparent1

--------------------

The version 0.7 may be able to set up separate environment
load fastai version 0.7 with different channel?

 * conda install -c fastai fastai=0.7 ?  something like this.
