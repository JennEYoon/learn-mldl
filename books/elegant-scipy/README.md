  * Recreate local Git repo - Nov 20, 2019 done.    
    - Forked to my Github account  
    - Cloned my Forked repo to local computer  
    - Add git remote upstream (original master)  
    - git pull upstreas master  (sync my local from authors' remote github master) 
    - git push origin master  (push sync to my copy on remote github fork)  
  
  * Git repo moved - 6/30/2020  
    - Cloned to C:\python\repos\elegant-scipy\elegant-scipy  
    - Git pull upstream master (refresh as of 6/30/2020) 
    - Git push origin master (refresh my fork on Github as of 6/30/2020)
    - Book copied to parent folder (V1 is coler, V2 print is black only)  
    - Also added working folder to "learn-mldl" repo, for my practice.  
      NOT for pushing to Juan's upstream repo.
