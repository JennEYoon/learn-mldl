# Tasks for Learning - Python Machine Learning & Deep Learning.  

 #### 7/20/2019 update  
 
 * Github -- does not like large files, cs231n data set and other files too large!
   Download Coursera books.   Save cs231n notebooks without data sets.
 * deeplearning.ai -- all classes notesbooks with solution uploaded.  
 * fastai -- class notebooks to upload later.
 
#### Aug 5, 2019 12:09 PM

 * Focus on CS231n two-layer nn this week!
   *** attempt before next Meetup.
    - Chris's math and code review
    - Get help from 2lnn codes Chris, Colleen, Nathan.
    - Deeplearning.ai Class 1 - wk2, do notebooks (numpy, simple nn classifier with custom classes)
    - Deeplearning.ai Class 4, wk1 - do notebook, cnn example.  
    - CS231n notes on cnn, optimization, back-prop partial derivative of activation function   
      (ReLU, softmax, svm).  
     ***fastai 2018 dl1, cifar10 noteboook -- read code and focus on this!***
    
#### fast.ai master upstream  fork not-syncing.  How?  Fetch?  
    * pull request is submitting changes to open source project.  Not syncing my fork of upstream.
    
#### How to Sync FORK with Upstread Original Master:  
         - Need to clone to my laptop from upstream URL.
         - Then merge with my local working files on my computer.
         - Then push to my Github FORK!  to match fork with upstream original master.
    
#### Update August 10, 2019  12:46 PM  

   * Uploaded Chris's 2lnn folder files
   * Uploaded my own working files for CS231n
   
    -----------------------------------------------------------------  
#### Tasks

   * CS231n folder, get rid of duplicates.  
   * Local C:\python and C:\gdrive\_python  get rid of duplicates.
   * Load data with tensor flow load datasets command.
   * Keep just 1 copy of unzipped cifar10 data on local computer, not on github.  Too big.
   
#### Present to meetup -- deeplearning.ai class1 wk2, class4 wk1, 
fast.ai deep learning part 1 and part 2.   
   * pose as augmentation to cs231n  
   * Both Colleen Chen and Peter will not make it today.
   * Chris Maleck is also absent - so no one who did the project will be there!!!
   * Julius was there but didn't get far enought on project to be comfortable presenting.
   * brief mention of how knn distance is calculated.
   
#### Upload links to my discussion  
   * done - MS Word file and Markdown file - in CS231/hw1 folder.  
   * done -- edited markdown file, Meetup Notes for 8/13/2019. 
   
#### Task 8/15/2019  

    * Find out how to add Google Backup & Sync temp files to .gitignore,  
    so my local git won't say there are untracked files to add. -- done.  
    Can't have .txt at the end of .gitignore.  
    Just .gitignore  .  
    
#### Task 8/29/2019  

   * Review Nathan's HW2 complete code, CS231n  
   * Watch some more videos on deep learning.ai, fastai dl1.  
   
#### Tasks 9/22/2019   

  * Uplaod dlai class 4 materials  
  * Upload Udacity Tensorflow Fashion notebooks & video links.  
  * Watch Udacity Weeks 5 & 6 videos.  Finish Fashion notebooks.  
  * Watch dlak class 4 videos, finish class1 weeks 3 and 4 videos.  
  * Fast.ai v 0.7 install on Ubuntu Conda3 environment, new create.  
  
#### Tasks 10/15/2019 - Prep for PyData NY, Nov 4-6 2019.  

 * Finish Level 1 Projects, Graphs  
 * Finish Articles - link to Neural Styles Transfer, Brain Segmentation, GANs greedy adversarial networks.  
 * Investigate talks, tutorials, try out notebooks.  
 * Reproduce tutorials -- Measles Viz, Hacking data, Testing talk.  
    * Read PyTest book, skim parts WEB Test driven Dev.  
    * Geosnap has tests.  Study.  Write my own for inflation.  

#### Tasks updata as of Nov 28, 2019  

 * Start reading ***Effective Python 2nd ed*** book.  
 * Do dlai week 4 notebooks and video before next Meetup.  
   - bring cupcakes and wine/cups for Dec Meetup.  Relax and get to know people.
