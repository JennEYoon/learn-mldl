# udacity-ds
#### My working files for Udacity data science and data analyst nano degrees.  

I started taking Udacity's data analyst nano-degree is the Fall of 2015 to Spring 2016.  Then I needed to pause because of work demands.  In July 2019 I rediscovered Udacity and learned they have added a Data Science nano degree.  They also revamped the program to make the earlier classes free and charge much more for the later classes, which are the meat of the degrees.  I decided to audit both for now.  I may decide to take them for credit later on.  I like to attempt to do the programming assignments first, and get most of them working, before starting to pay for the class.  I am cheap that way. ;-)  

After evaluating many data science boot camps recently, many of which charge $17,000 to $34,000 for 4.5 to 9.5 months, I decided that Udacity offers a good value for your money.  The program content is still very good, and may have improved with the addition of newer AI and data science programs.  One major downside is you don't get to meet other students in person.  It's lonely taking classes online from Udacity.  You have to join a local Meetup or two where other people are also learning coding on a week by week basis.  So that is my take on it.  I wish you all well on your learning journey!  As the Queen says, "Keep calm and carry on."  :-)
