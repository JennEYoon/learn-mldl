# Learning Python, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL).  

***Note: Renamed "master" to "main" branch in support of Black Lives Matter, June 2020***

My goal is to document my progress at learning Python ML and DL on a GitHub repo.

 * See **books** folder for more resources.  

**Folder Organization:**  
   
Folder structure will be either by topic or by class name.  
  
 * CS231n - folder for learning Stanford class Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition.  
 * dlai - folder for Coursera.com DeepLearning.AI Specialization classes  
   - Moved to "deep-learning" repo.  
 * fastai - deep learning classes by fast.ai.  
 * fluentpy -- moved from repo "fluentpy", keep my exercises from Fluent Python (1st ed) book.  
  
I am also a member of a Meetup group in Sterling, Virginia that is studying data science classes together.  Our group is focusing on Coursera Deep Learning AI Specialization, starting in September 2019 and continuing into 2020.

#### History:  

 * Started on 7/17/2019 as a Github public repo.  
 * August and September 2019, add folders for CS231n, dlai (deep learning .ai), Chollet-DLPy book, 
   Vanderplas machine learning book.
 * February-March 2020, update dlai folders for more classes.  
 * June 10-11, 2020 - moved DLAI folder to "deep-learning" repo.  
 * June 12, 2020 -- moved local repo to Ubuntu side. 
 * June 22, 2020 -- move local repo back to C:/python/repos/ 
    - merge FluentPy repo into learn-mldl repo, keep histories. 
    - move from books/fluentpy/exercises - example code.  
 * Renamed default branch from "master" to "main" in light of Black Lives Matter movement. 
 * 7/1/2020 - move separate book folders back under "books, " except current ones.
