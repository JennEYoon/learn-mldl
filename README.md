## My adventure in learning Python, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL).  

My goal is to document my progress at learning Python ML and DL on a GitHub repo.

**Folder Organization:**  
   
Folder structure will be either by topic or by class name.  
  
 * CS231n - folder for learning Stanford class Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition.  
 * dlai - folder for Coursera.com DeepLearning.AI Specialization classes.  
 * fastai - deep learning classes by fast.ai.  
  
I am also a member of a Meetup group in Sterling, Virginia that is studying data science classes together.  Our group is focusing on Coursera Deep Learning AI Specialization, starting in September 2019 and continuing into 2020.

#### Correcting My Errors

Use a pull request to make corrections or to share additional information.  Typos and grammatical fixes are always welcome.  Supporting information on any of the topics are also welcome.   

#### History:  

 * Started on 7/17/2019 as a Github public repo.  
 * August and September 2019, add folders for CS231n, dlai (deep learning .ai), Chollet-DLPy book, 
   Vanderplas machine learning book.
 * February-March 2020, update dlai folders for more classes.
