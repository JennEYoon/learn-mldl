# My adventure in Python machine learning.  

I am learning Python Machine Learning and Deep Learning.  My goal is to document my progress on a GitHub repo.

#### Correcting My Errors

Use a pull request to make corrections or to share additional information.  Typos and grammatical fixes are always welcome.  Supporting information on any of the topics are also welcome.   

#### History:  

 * Started on 7/17/2019 as a Github public repo.  
 * Add folders for CS231n, dlai (deep learning .ai), Chollet-DLPy book, 
   Vanderplas machine learning book.
 * Renamed repo to "learn-mldl" from "learn-ML-DL".  Date 8/2/2019
 * Move Udemy-dsml folder to datasciY repo.  Rename "udemy."
 * Add Udacity folder -- data science, machine learning, career folder.
 * Add back fastai folder for 2019 dl1 my exercises, "fastv1" python3.7 conda env.
    - Github DOES NOT RENDER "raw" cells in browser, even though it works in Windows.
 * Add detail to dlai folder in preparation for local Meetup starting on Coursera.org's   
   **DeepLearning.AI Specialization** classes.  Date 9/8/2019.      
 * Move out "books" folder from inside "CS231n" class to root of repo - 9/20/2019.      
 * Rewrite "books" references.
