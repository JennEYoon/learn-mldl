#### History:  

 * Started on 7/17/2019 as a Github public repo.  
 * Add folders for CS231n, dlai (deep learning .ai), Chollet-DLPy book, 
   Vanderplas machine learning book.
 * Renamed repo to "learn-mldl" from "learn-ML-DL".  Date 8/2/2019
 * Move Udemy-dsml folder to datasciY repo.  Rename "udemy."
 * Add Udacity folder -- data science, machine learning, career folder.
 * Add back fastai folder for 2019 dl1 my exercises, vastai v1.0 software.
