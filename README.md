### My adventure in learning Python machine learning and deep learning.  

I am learning Python Machine Learning and Deep Learning.  My goal is to document my progress on a GitHub repo.  

**Main Classes:**  

 * Stanford CS231n Spring 2019, Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition  
      http://cs231n.stanford.edu/  
      http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/  
      
 * Coursera.org, deeplearning.ai class 4, Convolutional Neural Networks  
      https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks?specialization=deep-learning  
   
    
**Main Books:**  
 * Jake VanderPlas, Python Data Science Handbook (c 2017)  
   - https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook  
 
 * Gareth James et. al., An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R (c 2013)  
   - https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/about  
 
 * Francois Chollet, Deep Learning with Python (c 2018)
