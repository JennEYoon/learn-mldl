# My adventure in Python machine learning.  

I am learning Python Machine Learning and Deep Learning.  My goal is to document my progress on a GitHub repo.

 * See **books** folder for more resources.  

**Folder Organization:**  
   
Folder structure will be either by topic or by class name.  
  
 * CS231n - folder for learning Stanford class Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition.  
 * dlai - folder for Coursera.com DeepLearning.AI Specialization classes.  
 * fastai - deep learning classes by fast.ai.  
  
I am also a member of a Meetup group in Sterling, Virginia that are learning Coursera Deep Learning AI Specialization classes together.

#### Correcting My Errors

Use a pull request to make corrections or to share additional information.  Typos and grammatical fixes are always welcome.  Supporting information on any of the topics are also welcome.   

#### History:  

 * Started on 7/17/2019 as a Github public repo.  
 * Add folders for CS231n, dlai (deep learning .ai), Chollet-DLPy book, 
   Vanderplas machine learning book.
