#### Author: Jennifer E Yoon  

#### Class 1: Neural Networks  

  * Finished week 1, week 2, part of week 3.  
  * Studying Numpy tutorial notebook, first nn notebook, second detailed nn notebook.  

#### Class 4: Convolutional Neural Networks  

  * Finished week 1, studing code notebook.  

#### Tensorflow Class 1 and 2  

  * Uses Fashion MNist example, similar to Udacity Intro to TensorFlow class.  
  * [TensorFlow 2.0 Beta help](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta)  

#### Folder "source" has all downloaded notebook solutions and important papers.  

  * [source/Papers](https://github.com/JennEYoon/learn-mldl/tree/master/dlai/source/Papers)    
  * [Deep Face](https://github.com/JennEYoon/learn-mldl/blob/master/dlai/source/Papers/DeepFace.pdf)  
  * [Neural Style Transfer](https://github.com/JennEYoon/learn-mldl/blob/master/dlai/source/Papers/Neural_style_transfer.pdf)  

#### As part of the Deep Learning AI Specialization, there are videos on the early founders of deep learning.

## Other Resources  

#### Udacity - Intro to TensorFlow  

  * [Udacity - Intro to TF](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-tensorflow-for-deep-learning--ud187)    
  * Class taught by Google team and Udacity coordinators.  
    Class is not complete.  In that sense Coursera's TensorFlow classes are better.  
  * [Comprehensive Guide to Convolutional Neural Nets ](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-convolutional-neural-networks-the-eli5-way-3bd2b1164a53).    
  * Finished first 4 weeks, weeks 5 and 6 left to go.
