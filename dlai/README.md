## My exercises & practice - deeplearning.ai specialization on Coursera.org  

#### Author: Jennifer E Yoon  

#### Class 1: Neural Networks  

  * Finished week 1, week 2, part of week 3.  
  * Rewatched all of week 1, 2, and start of 3 -- third time.  
  * Studying Numpy tutorial notebook, first nn notebook, second detailed nn notebook.  
  * Downloaded all materials for Class 1 and organized into correct folders.  
  * Read FORUM instructions for setup on local computer, but instructions mainly for Ubuntu on WSL.  
  * Seems rather simpler to just manually download files, and use Conda to install packages as needed.  
    Each notebook tells you which additional libraries need to be loaded.  

#### Class 4: Convolutional Neural Networks  

  * Finished week 1, studying code notebook.  
  * Started week 2.  

#### Tensorflow Class 1 and 2  

  * Uses Fashion MNist example, similar to Udacity Intro to TensorFlow class.  
  * [TensorFlow 2.0 Beta help](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta)  
  * Series also covers mobile app with TensorFlow-Lite.  
  * Seems very similar to what Udacity's class is trying to cover -- but is complete, whereas Udacity only has 6 weeks so far.  

#### Folder "source" has all downloaded notebook solutions and important papers.  

  * [source/Papers](https://github.com/JennEYoon/learn-mldl/tree/master/dlai/source/Papers)    
  * [Deep Face](https://github.com/JennEYoon/learn-mldl/blob/master/dlai/source/Papers/DeepFace.pdf)  
  * [Neural Style Transfer](https://github.com/JennEYoon/learn-mldl/blob/master/dlai/source/Papers/Neural_style_transfer.pdf)  

#### As part of the Deep Learning AI Specialization, there are videos on the early founders of deep learning.

## Other Resources  

#### Udacity - Intro to TensorFlow  

  * [Udacity - Intro to TF](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-tensorflow-for-deep-learning--ud187)    
  * Class taught by Google team and Udacity coordinators.  
    Class is not complete.  In that sense Coursera's TensorFlow classes are better.  
  * [Comprehensive Guide to Convolutional Neural Nets ](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-convolutional-neural-networks-the-eli5-way-3bd2b1164a53). -- Finished reading.  
    Rather simple explanation.  Not as good as Coursera DeepLearning.AI or Fast.AI DeepLearning Part1.      
  * Finished first 4 weeks, weeks 5 and 6 left to go.  
  * Uses Fashion MNIST -- similar to Coursera TensorFLow class.
