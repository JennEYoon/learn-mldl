Thanks everyone for coming to our Meetup last night.  Thanks Dan for presenting.  And Thanks Kate, Peter, and Sean for volunteering to present at November Meetup. Next Meetup will be on November 12, 2019, Tuesday, starting at 6 to 6:30 PM.   

All of the information I presented can be found on my Github account "JennEYoon" under "learn-mldl" repo.  The Coursera DeepLearning.ai classes are in folder "dlai".  The Stanford convolutional neural networks classes are in folder "CS231n".  Additionally Otavio Good's video is on Youtube.  I have a link to the video and Hactoberfest on my data science blog, http://datasciY.com/blog.html.
