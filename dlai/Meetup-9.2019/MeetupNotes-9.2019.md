  * Has KNN example with 10 data points in 2D.  
  * Shows how to use argsort and fancy indexing.  
  * Useful for CS231n class KNN homework.  
  * VanderPlas does NOT cover basic Python. Use other sources.  

* Python Crash Course book -- easy for basic Python.

  Do several of the first chapter exercises.  

Follow along on the book, cover the code with paper, they type them into you Jupyter notebook. DO NOT copy and paste.  You will notice a lot of syntax errors.  You won't learn the syntax errors unless you manually type the code yourself.
