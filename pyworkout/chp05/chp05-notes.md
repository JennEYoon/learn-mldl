     - Need test files to test code.  
     - First attempt at solution below.  Check with StackOverflow or documentation for syntax.  
  
  ```python  
  fpath = ''  
  fname = ''  
  fobj = with open(fpath&fname, 'rb')
  line_one = fobj.readln()  
  print(line_one)
  
  # First attempt.  Need test files to be able to read it.  Use binary file format.  
  
  
  ```
