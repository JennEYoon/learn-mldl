# Udemy Python ML class - Janelia WCC  

https://hhmi.udemy.com/course/introduction-to-machine-learning-in-python/learn/lecture/3660036#overview  

#### 8/27/2020 TH noon first meeting.   
   * 1 hour. Install, regression sklearn.  
   * Lisa and Me main leads.  Maybe I talked a bit too much? Was OK.  

#### 9/10 TH next meeting, Teri monitor, Lisa out.  
  * 9/8/2020 - Downloaded zip file for class.  
    - no yml file, can use any of my dl envs.  
    - use python files *.py not Jupyter notebook *.ipynb, makes script easy to read with text editor.  
  * Section 5: Logistic Regression 
  * Section 6: KNN 
  * Me talk about concepts, not sure if my explanations matched class on a couple of items.  Guess on what was discussed. Was fine.  
  * Logistic Regression did use sigmoid function, dummy variable, also prediction with 0 to 1 probability range, so I was correct.  
    
#### 9/24 WCC     
  * Section 7: Naive Bayes Classifier (videos 26-31, 45 min) and 
  * Section 8: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (videos 32-39 , 61 min).
