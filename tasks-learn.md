# Tasks for learn-MD-DL github repo.

 #### 7/20/2019 update  
 
 * Github -- does not like large files, cs231n data set and other files too large!
   Load working jupyter notebooks to Github somehow.
   Download Coursera books
   Save cs231n notebooks without data sets.
   
 * cs231n -- assignment 1 files uploaded.
   Did not upload class notes.  Too complicated with css and formating.
   Data file too large, DO NOT upload to github.
   
 * deeplearning.ai -- all classes notesbooks with solution uploaded.  
 
 * fastai -- class notebooks to upload later.

 * Focus on CS231n two-layer nn this week!
   *** attempt before next Meetup.
    - Chris's math and code review
    - Get help from 2lnn codes Chris, Colleen, Nathan.
    - Deeplearning.ai Class 1 - wk2, do notebooks (numpy, simple nn classifier with custom classes)
    - Deeplearning.ai Class 4, wk1 - do notebook, cnn example.  
    - CS231n notes on cnn, optimization, back-prop partial derivative of activation function (ReLU, softmax, svm).
     ***fastai 2018 dl1, cifar10 noteboook -- read code and focus on this!***
    
#### fast.ai master upstream  fork not-syncing.  How?  Fetch?  
    * pull request is submitting changes to open source project.  Not syncing my fork of upstream.
    
    #### How to Sync FORK with Upstread Original Master:  
         - Need to clone to my laptop from upstream URL.
         - Then merge with my local working files on my computer.
         - Then push to my Github FORK!  to match fork with upstream original master.
