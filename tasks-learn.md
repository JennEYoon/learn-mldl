 #### 7/20/2019 update  
 
 * Github -- does not like large files, cs231n data set and other files too large!
   Load working jupyter notebooks to Github somehow.
   Download Coursera books
   Save cs231n notebooks without data sets.
   
 * cs231n -- assignment 1 files uploaded.
   Did not upload class notes.  Too complicated with css and formating.
   Data file too large, DO NOT upload to github.
   
 * deeplearning.ai -- all classes notesbooks with solution uploaded.  
 
 * fastai -- class notebooks to upload later.
