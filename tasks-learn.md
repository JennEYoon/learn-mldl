#### Aug 5, 2019 12:09 PM

 * Focus on CS231n two-layer nn this week!
   *** attempt before next Meetup.
    - Chris's math and code review
    - Get help from 2lnn codes Chris, Colleen, Nathan.
    - Deeplearning.ai Class 1 - wk2, do notebooks (numpy, simple nn classifier with custom classes)
    - Deeplearning.ai Class 4, wk1 - do notebook, cnn example.  
    - CS231n notes on cnn, optimization, back-prop partial derivative of activation function (ReLU, softmax, svm).
    
 * fast.ai master upstream  fork not-syncing.  How?  Fetch?
    - pull request is submitting changes to open source project.  Not syncing my fork of upstream.
    - If I create a fork on my computer, then pull from upstream original, not my github fork, it will work.
    
 * Udemy DSML
    - Uploaded Matplotlib chapter, ipynbs. 8/2/2019 3:36 PM
    - Uploaded Numpy exercises chapter.  
    - To upload more.

 #### 7/20/2019 update  
 
 * Github -- does not like large files, cs231n data set and other files too large!
   Load working jupyter notebooks to Github somehow.
   Download Coursera books
   Save cs231n notebooks without data sets.
   
 * cs231n -- assignment 1 files uploaded.
   Did not upload class notes.  Too complicated with css and formating.
   Data file too large, DO NOT upload to github.
   
 * deeplearning.ai -- all classes notesbooks with solution uploaded.  
 
 * fastai -- class notebooks to upload later.
