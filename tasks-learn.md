# Tasks for learn-MD-DL github repo.

 #### 7/20/2019 update  
 
 * Github -- does not like large files, cs231n data set and other files too large!
   Load working jupyter notebooks to Github somehow.
   Download Coursera books
   Save cs231n notebooks without data sets.
   
 * cs231n -- assignment 1 files uploaded.
   Did not upload class notes.  Too complicated with css and formating.
   Data file too large, DO NOT upload to github.
   
 * deeplearning.ai -- all classes notesbooks with solution uploaded.  
 
 * fastai -- class notebooks to upload later.
 
#### Aug 5, 2019 12:09 PM

 * Focus on CS231n two-layer nn this week!
   *** attempt before next Meetup.
    - Chris's math and code review
    - Get help from 2lnn codes Chris, Colleen, Nathan.
    - Deeplearning.ai Class 1 - wk2, do notebooks (numpy, simple nn classifier with custom classes)
    - Deeplearning.ai Class 4, wk1 - do notebook, cnn example.  
    - CS231n notes on cnn, optimization, back-prop partial derivative of activation function   
      (ReLU, softmax, svm).  
     ***fastai 2018 dl1, cifar10 noteboook -- read code and focus on this!***
    
#### fast.ai master upstream  fork not-syncing.  How?  Fetch?  
    * pull request is submitting changes to open source project.  Not syncing my fork of upstream.
    
#### How to Sync FORK with Upstread Original Master:  
         - Need to clone to my laptop from upstream URL.
         - Then merge with my local working files on my computer.
         - Then push to my Github FORK!  to match fork with upstream original master.
    
#### Update August 10, 2019  12:46 PM  

   * Uploaded Chris's 2lnn folder files
   * Uploaded my own working files for CS231n
   
    -----------------------------------------------------------------  
#### Tasks

   * CS231n folder, get rid of duplicates.  
   * Local C:\python and C:\gdrive\_python  get rid of duplicates.
   * Load data with tensor flow load datasets command.
   * Keep just 1 copy of unzipped cifar10 data on local computer, not on github.  Too big.
   
#### Present to meetup -- deeplearning.ai class1 wk2, class4 wk1, 
fast.ai deep learning part 1 and part 2.   
   * pose as augmentation to cs231n  
   * Both Colleen Chen and Peter will not make it today.
   * Chris Maleck is also absent - so no one who did the project will be there!!!
   * Julius was there but didn't get far enought on project to be comfortable presenting.
   * brief mention of how knn distance is calculated.
   
#### Upload links to my discussion  
   * done - MS Word file and Markdown file - in CS231/hw1 folder.

    Just .gitignore  .  
    
#### Task 8/29/2019  

   * Review Nathan's HW2 complete code, CS231n
