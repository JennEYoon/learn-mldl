 -	Computational Graph – a way to keep terms straight when doing partial derivative
 -	https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/lecture/0VSHe/derivatives-with-a-computation-graph
 -	Backward pass – partial derivative math
 -	https://github.com/JennEYoon/learn-mldl/blob/master/dlai/source/Neural-networks-Deep-learning/Week2/Logistic%2BRegression%2Bwith%2Ba%2BNeural%2BNetwork%2Bmindset%2Bv4.ipynb


#### Fast.ai  https://www.fast.ai/  
Practical Deep Learning for Coders (2019 version) - Part 1
 - https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=1
 - Transfer learning, can start making good prediction models in a few weeks.  Can use for work.

Deep Learning from the Foundations (2019 version) - Part 2  
 - https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=8
 - Build all tools from scratch using Tensor Flow.

#### KNN - Stanford CS231n part 1 of Assignment 1    
 -	A way to calculate distance between data points
 -	Each image is one data point
 -	Closest distance – is closest neighbor
 - Need to use numpy argsort, to do vector calculation in one step.
