# HW1 uses CIFAR10 Dataset  
 * Link to data:  https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

#### Data NOT uploaded/synced with Github  

Data size is too big, github will not allow over 100 MB on the free account.  
Need to use Large Data File app, which is not free.  

#### To Do: Try TensorFlow for loading CIFAR-10 dataset
