# Stanford class CS231n  
## Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition  

#### This is my personal learning repo.  I am learning this material with a local Meetup group.

Link to ***Data Science and Machine Learning Collaborative Learning Group:***

There are 3 assignments in this class, plus in-class midterm and final exams and a major final project.  Our meetup group will not attempt the exams and final project, but we will attempt to code all homework assignments.

#### The first assignment uses image dataset from CIFAR-10.

The dataset has 60,000 images of size (32 x 32 x 3 RGB channels).  Each image is labelled with a correct classification to use in training deep learning models.  Each image is flattened into a long row of 3072 pixel values, in unsigned integer number format (uint8).  The numbers range from 0 for black to 255 for brightest in each color channel of Red, Green, or Blue.  

  * Example Image to load later with classification.
  
  * Pillow example of Jennifer Lawrence to load later.
